* 1.build_a_bot

Course covering stateless systems using regex & spacy word vectors to
derive intent and entities in natural language. Moves on to state and
pending state systems, policies and natural language understanding using
the `rasa_nlu` library. Problem with this part of the course - significant
breaking changes since it was written mean that I have not been able to
reproduce the results.

<p style="color:red;">TODO:</p>

* [Course Author tutorial on deploying a chatbot to Facebook messenger.](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/facebook-chatbot-python-deploy)
* [Explore the RASA training.](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/) - Once oriented around v3,
`./1.build_a_bot/` could be updated for compatoble with latest v of API.
